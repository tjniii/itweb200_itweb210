In this project, I utilized Node.js and Express to develop the backend that 
communicates with the frontend. I encountered issues with CORS and resolved 
them by installing the cors library in Node.js.

Regarding the frontend, I faced challenges with refreshing data after deletion 
or editing. To address this, I implemented a function to call the API and retrieve 
the updated list of items every time a deletion or edit operation occurs.
