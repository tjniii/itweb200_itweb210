    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>

    <p> HTML creates and structures the website's content, CSS adds style and formatting to these structures, and then JavaScript turns those stylized components into something that a user can interact with.</p>
