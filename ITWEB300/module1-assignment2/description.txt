1. A list of classes with descriptions of each class, the class variables, the class methods with purpose, arguments, return types, and the code used to implement the class.

- Class: Ticket
- Variables: id, number, customerName, customerEmail, problem
- Method1: validate() -> boolean
- Method2: printSummary() -> string


- Class TicketList
- Variable: list
- Method1: addTicket(ticket) -> void
- Method2: printTicketList() -> string
- Method3: seachByTicketNumber(ticketNumber) -> array
- Method4: setTicketList(ticketList) -> void


2. 1-2 paragraph discussion of your experience with the assignment and issues you faced.  

- Using class and objects help me to organize the better, easier to debug and maintance. 
- The issue I encountered was in the search function where i had to filter the existing list. I wan't sure how to load it from the existing function,
so i ended up creating a new function seachByTicketNumber() in TicketList to handle the task.
