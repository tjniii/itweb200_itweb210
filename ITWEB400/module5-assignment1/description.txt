1. There are 2 major parts of the full stack system monitoring and maintenance process
    1.1: Event Logging and Analysis
    Collecting and analyzing logs and events generated by various components within the system is crucial 
    for troubleshooting and identifying patterns or anomalies. Centralized logging systems aggregate logs 
    from different sources, allowing administrators to correlate events and detect issues across the system.
    1.2: Alerting and Notification:
    Setting up alerts based on predefined thresholds or conditions is essential for timely response to 
    potential issues. Alerts can notify administrators or operations teams via email, SMS, or other 
    channels when certain metrics exceed thresholds or when specific events occur. This enables proactive 
    intervention before problems escalate.
    1.3: Backup and Recovery
    Implementing robust backup and disaster recovery strategies ensures data integrity and business continuity. 
    This includes regular backups of critical data, testing backup integrity, and having contingency 
    plans in place to recover from unexpected events or disasters.

2. 
    2.1 ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):
    The ELK Stack is a popular open-source solution for log management and analytics. It consists of 
    Elasticsearch for indexing and searching logs, Logstash for log collection and processing, and Kibana 
    for visualizing and analyzing log data. The ELK Stack is widely used for centralized logging and 
    troubleshooting.

    2.2 AWS CloudWatch:
    AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
    It collects and monitors metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications running on AWS. 
    CloudWatch can be used for infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, and resource 
    optimization within AWS.

    2.3 Datadog:
    Datadog is a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform that provides full-stack observability. 
    It supports infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), log management, 
    and synthetic monitoring. Datadog integrates with numerous technologies and services, offering 
    comprehensive insights into system performance.

3. Monitoring and maintenance are essential for managing systems, whether small-scale or enterprise-level, 
   with benefits including early issue detection, performance optimization, ensuring reliability and availability, 
   scalability planning, security and compliance adherence, cost efficiency, and enhancing user experience.
